    <b>quadEM</b> supports the Quad Electrometer built by <a href="mailto:skross@aps.anl.gov">
      Steve Ross</a> from the APS. This device consists of a 4-channel digital electrometer
    unit and 2 VME boards. It is typically used for photodiode-based x-ray beam position
    monitors, although it can be used for any low-current measurement that requires
    high speed digital input. The device provides 2 readings per diode at up to 813
    Hz. Steve has written an extensive <a href="Electrometer Users Guide 01_22_2007.pdf">
      Electometer User's Guide</a></p>
  <p>
    The <b>quadEM</b> software includes an asyn driver that provides support for the
    following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Analog input records using the standard asyn device support. This provides digitally
      averaged readings of the current, sum, difference and position at speeds up to 10
      Hz with standard EPICS scan times.</li>
    <li>mca record. This provide a time-history (like a digital scope) of the current,
      sum, difference and position at speeds up to 813 Hz. The time per point can be greater
      than the sampling time in which case it does averaging.</li>
    <li>epid (fast feedback). This provides fast feedback via an asyn D/A converter (e.g.
      dac128V) at speeds up to 813Hz. If it is run slower than the sampling time it does
      signal averaging.</li>
  </ul>

    Databases</h2>
  <h3>
    quadEM.db</h3>
  <p>
    The quadEM.db database provides control of the electrometer and analog input records
    using the standard asyn device support. This provides digitally averaged readings
    of the current, sum, difference and position at speeds up to 10 Hz with standard
    EPICS scan times.</p>

          Gain command. This selects the feedback capacitor, which controls the gain of the
          device. There are 8 capacitor choices. The choices are External, 2.51, 2.93, 3.52,
          4.40, 5.87, 8.80, and 17.6 pF. All gains except the first External gain use capacitors
          that are built in to the Burr Brown chip. These are quite small capacitors and only
          cover a narrow range, so the gains are quite high, and only rather low currents
          can be measured with them, even at the shortest integration times. The external
          capacitors can be replaced to select the first gain, and boards are normally built
          with 220 pF external capacitors. At APS 13-ID we have used much larger values, 1000
          to 5000 pF, because the currents from our undulator beam position monitor are large.
          There are actually 8 external capacitors: 4 of them control the gain for each input
          for the "ping" channel, and the other 4 control the gain for the "pong" channel.
          By using one capacitor value for the 4 diodes on the ping channel and a different
          capacitor value for the 4 diodes on the pong channel, then two user-selectable gains
          are available. One must then select the appropriate channel in the PingPong1 to
          PingPong4 records, and not use the average.</td>

          one value in the Ping channel and one value in the Pong channel. The data period
          is thus 1.23ms to 26.22 ms, or a frequency of about 813 Hz to 38.1 Hz. As the integration

  <h2>
    Fast feedback
  </h2>
  <p>
    The quadEM can be used to do fast feedback with the EPID record from the synApps
    "std" module. The EPID record will process at up to 813 Hz. The DT field of the
    EPID record controls the time between feedback calculations, and this is constrained
    to be an integer multiple N of the quadEM sampling time. If N>1 then N samples are
    averaged for each feedback operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following is an example substitutions file for this. This example uses a quadEM
    asyn port driver named "quadEM1". ICHAN is set to read from addr=8 and 9, which
    are the two position values of the quadEM driver. The INPUT_DATA and INPUT_INTERVAL
    strings are the drvInfo strings for these parameters in the driver. The output is
    sent to an asyn port driver named DAC1, which is a dac128V 12-bit A/D converter
    in this data. OCHAN is set to write to addr=2 and 1, which are the second and third
    DAC channels on that card. The OUTPUT_DATA string is the drvInfo string for the
    data in the dac128V.

    This is the medm screen that controls the fast feedback of the pitch of the monochromator
    on APS beamline 13-ID. The readback and control PVs cannot be changed after iocInit.
    The update rate (SCAN rate of EPID record) only controls the rate at which the EPID
    record displays "snapshots" of the values of the input, output, and error. It does
    not affect the rate at which the feedback is actually being done, which can be much
    faster than this.

  <p>
    This is the medm screen that controls the PID parameters. These include the feedback
    coefficients KP, KI, and KD. The DT (delta time) field controls the rate at which
    the feedback is actually been run. In this case DT=68.0 ms, which is 55 times longer
    than the sampling time (1.23 ms), so 55 position readings are being averaged each
    time the feedback is run.

    This is an medm screen that displays the setpoint of the pitch of the monochromator
    (in red), and the actual readback from the quadEM (in blue). Note that the readback
    here is only the snapshot values from the EPID record. For full-speed readings of
    the readback the MCA records from the quadEM_med.db database would be used.
