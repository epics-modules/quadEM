    quadEM Release Notes</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-0 (December XXX, 2015)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for the CaenEls TetrAMM picoammeter. This device uses Gbit Ethernet
      without a built-in Ethernet to serial converter, so it is significantly faster than
      the AH501 and AH401 series. It supports on-board digital averaging.</li>
    <li>The base class and derived classes have changed somewhat to add this TetrAMM support,
      some of the database record names and types have changed, and changes are required
      to startup scripts. This is thus a new major release number. Some of the changes
      include
      <ul>
        <li>The Trigger record has been renamed to TriggerMode.</li>
        <li>The TriggerMode record choices are now device-dependent.</li>
        <li>The Firmware record changed from stringin to waveform to handle longer strings.</li>
        <li>New records were added for the TetrAMM (BiasInterlock, HVSReadback, HVVReadback,
          HVIReadback, and Temperature).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added support for the NSLS electrometer from Peter Siddons. It is called NSLS_EM
      in this software. It is quite similar to the AH401B and APS electrometer, using
      a similar current integrator chip. It has a minimum integration time of 400 microseconds,
      and thus a maximum sample rate of 2500 Hz. It uses Ethernet communication, UDP to
      search for modules on the subnet and TCP to send commands and read data.</li>
    <li>The CurrentScaleN and ReadStatus.SCAN records were added to save/restore, they
      were previously missing.</li>
    <li>Added support for reading the AH401, AH501, and TetrAMM meters in ASCII mode,
      as well as the binary mode that was previously supported. Binary mode can occassionally
      get out of sync, because there are no terminators between readings. ASCII mode is
      slower, but should not have a problem getting out of sync. The new ReadFormat record
      is used to select Binary or ASCII.</li>
    <li>Template files in $(TOP)/quadEMApp/Db are now installed into $(TOP)/db when building
      and the example IOC now loads them from the install directory.</li>
    <li>The device-specific template files now load the base class quadEM.template file
      using an "include" statement, so the base file no longer needs to be explicitly
      loaded in the startup script. This means that $(QUADEM)/db must be added to EPICS_DB_INCLUDE_PATH.</li>
    <li>This release requires areaDetector ADCore R2-4 or later.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 5-0 (October 14, 2014)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Supported a new geometry where the current sources are arranged in a square array
      with 2 on the top and 2 on the bottom, in addition to the previous diamond geometry
      of top, bottom, left right. The sum, difference and position calculations are done
      differently in this geometry.</li>
    <li>Added a new Geometry PV that controls which geometry (Diamond, Square) is used
      in the calculations.</li>
    <li>Because the diodes that contribute to the sum, difference and position calculations
      depend on the geometry, the names of the Sum, Diff and Position PVs have changed.
      <ul>
        <li>Sum12, Sum34 have changed to SumX, SumY</li>
        <li>Diff12, Diff34 have changed to DiffX, DiffY</li>
        <li>Position12, Position34 have changed to PositionX, PositionY</li>
        <li>Sum1234 has changed to SumAll</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 4-1 (April 14, 2014)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added new AcquireMode record to support both Continuous and One-shot acquisition
      modes. Previously only continuous acquisition was supported. One-shot acquires the
      data from one AveragingTime and then stops acquisition. One-shot mode can be used
      with either triggered or free-running acquisition.<br />
      Note: Correct operation of the One-shot mode and triggered modes on the AH501D requires
      firmware version 2.0 or later. Previous firmware versions have bugs that prevent
      correct operation in these modes. The firmware can be updated in the field.</li>
    <li>The Acquire record was changed from a bo to a busy record to support use with
      the sscan record when AcquireMode=One-shot.</li>
    <li>Added optional "modelName" parameter to the constructors and configuration commands
      for the startup scripts. This allows one to specify what model of AH401x or AH501x
      is being used. The driver attempts to detect this automatically from the firmware
      version it reads from the device, but some of the Elettra units have strange firmware
      version strings so this can fail.</li>
    <li>Fix to allow fast feedback to work on APS_EM.</li>
    <li>Added new Firmware stringin record containing the firmware version from the device.</li>
    <li>Changed to use R2-0 of areaDetector. It only uses the ADCORE and ADBINARIES modules.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 4-0 (March 12, 2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Major update of the module. The device-dependent classes (AHxxx, APS_EM) have
      not changed signficantly. However the base quadEM class has been rewritten. In R3-x
      the quadEM base class worked as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>The ai records for the 11 parameters (Current[1-3],Sum[12,34,1234],Diff[12,34],
          and Position[12,34]) were computed using the asynInt32Average device support.
        </li>
        <li>This meant that there were 11 callbacks each time a new value came from the electrometer,
          or more than 70,000 callbacks per second under some circumstances. This was a significant
          CPU load.</li>
        <li>This approach produced average values, but it did not produce other useful statistics
          like the standard deviation, histogram of values, etc.</li>
        <li>There was no good way to stream all of the readings to a disk file for an arbitrarily
          long time. The TimeSeries support was limited to a fixed time length, limited by
          available memory.</li>
      </ul>
      R4-0 addresses these problems as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>The quadEM base class is now derived from the asynNDArray class in areaDetector,
          rather than directly from asynPortDriver.</li>
        <li>The data from the device-dependent drivers are now first placed into a ring buffer
          whose size is defined in the constructor.</li>
        <li>There is a new PV called AveragingTime that determines the time period over which
          to average the readings. The AveragingTime divided by the SampleTime determines
          the number of samples to average, NumAverage_RBV. When this number of samples have
          been accumulated in the ring buffer a separate thread copies them to a set of NDArrays
          and calls any registered plugins. </li>
        <li>There is a separate NDPluginStats plugin loaded for each of the 11 data values.
          This plugin receives an array of dimensions [NumAverage_RBV]. This plugin computes
          not only the mean (as in the previous version), but also the standard deviation,
          histogram of values, etc.</li>
        <li>One of the NDArrays contains all of the data values, and has dimensions [11,NumAverage_RBV].
          This array can be passed to any of the file writing plugins, which can thus stream
          all of the data to disk for arbitrarily long time periods.</li>
        <li>An NDStdArrays plugin is also loaded. This can be used to pass all of the data
          [11,NumAverage_RBV] or any of the individual data arrays to any channel access client.</li>
        <li>This new approach provides much more information and flexibility. But it also
          significantly reduces the number of callbacks. For example if the averaging time
          is 1 second the number of callbacks is reduced from thousands per second to 12 per
          second, because the data are being passed in arrays.</li>
        <li>The computationally intensive work of calculating the statistics is now being
          done in plugins, so can be done in different threads, each potentially running in
          a separate core on modern CPUs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 3-3 (December 20, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed problem with mutex locking on AH401 (and perhaps AH501). The lock was not
      being released for in the read task for long enough to allow EPICS to quickly stop
      acquisition.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 3-2 (December 6, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug in reading binary data from AH501 meters. The manual incorrectly documented
      the binary data format.</li>
    <li>New version of the AH501D manual that correctly documents the binary data format.</li>
    <li>Minor changes to avoid compiler warnings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 3-1 (September 13, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for AH401D and the AH501 series (AH501, AH501C, AH501D) picoammeters
      from CaenEls. The AH501 series are significantly faster than the AH401 series. They
      work differently than the AH401 or APS_EM units, and do not support the concept
      of integration time or ping-pong. They have programmable resolution (16-bit or 24-bits),
      programmable number of active input channels (1, 2, or 4), and programmable bias
      power supply (AH501C and AH501D only).</li>
    <li>Added new record NumAverage. This applies to all models, and can be used to average
      NumAverage readings from the meter before doing the callbacks. On the AH501 series
      this also reduces the number of read operations by a factor of NumAverage, by increasing
      the number of messages read in a single operation. This reduces CPU time in direct
      proportion to NumAverage, which is particularly important with slow computers (e.g.
      older VME cards) with the AH501 series.</li>
    <li>Tested using UDP rather than TCP for communication with the AH401B and AH501 meters.
      This is more efficient than TCP, reducing CPU time by up to 10%. The example startup
      scripts now use UDP. The Lantronix DeviceInstaller must be used to configure the
      electrometer to use UDP, since the default is TCP.</li>
    <li>Added new record Model. This provides the model index and name of the device.
      This is determined automatically by the driver.</li>
    <li>Modified the medm screens so they only display the parameters that apply to the
      specific model being used.</li>
    <li>Modified startup scripts to simplify and support testing all models on any OS
      (for AH401 and AH501 series), and vxWorks for APS_EM.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 3-0 (September 6, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete re-write of the module. The new version is based on asynPortDriver. It
      consists of a base class, drvQuadEM.cpp, and two derived classes:
      <ol>
        <li>drvAH401B.cpp which is new support for the AH401B picoammeter designed and sold
          by <a href="http://ilo.elettra.trieste.it/index.php?page=_layout_prodotto&amp;id=54&amp;lang=en">
            Synchrotron Trieste (elettra)</a>. It is also sold by <a href="http://www.caenels.com/caenels/product.php?fam=cemis&amp;mod=AH401B">
              CAENels</a>. </li>
        <li>drvAPS_EM.cpp, which is improved support for the APS electrometer designed by
          Steve Ross.</li>
      </ol>
      The new version is not completely backwards compatible with the previous version,
      and will require modification of startup scripts and medm screens. </li>
    <li>Added support for power-spectra calculations using FFTs on time-series arrays.
      These now run in the IOC, rather than requiring a separate Channel Access client,
      which previous releases required.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 2-6 (November 2, 2011)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for the remote reboot capability of the electrometer. This makes
      initialization much simpler and more robust, since it can be done with software
      commands rather than power-cycling and toggling switches. It is only supported on
      newer electrometer firmware, but does not cause ill effects when sent to older electrometers.
      Added a Reboot record to the database, and modified the Initialize seq record to
      process the Reboot record as the first thing it does.</li>
    <li>Added an additional optional parameter to initQuadEM. This is the drvInfo field
      for the ipUnidig module. Previously the driver hardcoded pasynUser-&gt;reason=0
      when using the asynUInt32Digital interface. Now it uses drvUser-&gt;create, which
      is the correct way to do it.</li>
    <li>Created new documentation file, <a href="quadEMDoc.html">quadEMDoc.html</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 2-5 (Sept 9, 2011)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Modified RELEASE; deleted RELEASE.arch.</li>
    <li>Added .opi display files, for CSS-BOY</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">

  <ul>
    <li>Support parallel build.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">

  <ul>
    <li>Removed unused functions in driver.</li>
    <li>Added new adl file quadEM_less.adl.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in quadEM_settings.req.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 2-3 (Sept. 6, 2006)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed driver so that configuration routines can be called from iocsh.</li>
  </ul>
