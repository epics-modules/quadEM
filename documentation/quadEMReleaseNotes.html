    quadEM Release Notes</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 9-2-1 (August 9, 2019)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated autoconverted edl files.</li>
    <li>Fixed Makefile to optionally build with SNCSEQ.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 9-2 (September 13, 2018)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for an additional averaging method. The driver currently uses the
      NDPluginStats plugin to do the "primary averaging". The NDPluginStats plugin provides
      additional statistics, such as sigma, skewness, histogram, etc. It is typically
      set to run at a fairly long averaging time in the range of 0.1 - 1 second. It can
      be run for much shorter times, but then the sigma and histogram calculations are
      less useful. There is sometimes a need for an additional averaging mechanism that
      can be run independently of the primary averaging, and this has now been added.
      One use case is for running feedback at a faster rate than primary averaging is
      running. The new averaging method is called "fast averaging", though there is actually
      no requirement that it run faster than the primary averaging. The fast averaging
      computes only the mean of each value (currents, sums, differences, and positions),
      and not sigma, etc. It uses the drvAsynFloat64Average device support. asyn R4-34
      or higher is required because that is when I/O Intr scanning for this device support
      was added. The FastAverageScan is typically set to "I/O Intr". In this case the
      FastAveragingTime is used to compute the number of samples to average (NumFastAverage),
      and the fast averaging records will process each time this number of readings has
      been received. The records can also be processed periodically by setting FastAverageScan="1
      second", etc. If fast averaging is not needed it can be disabled by setting FastAverageScan="Passive".</li>
    <li>Changed iocBoot/commonPlugins.cmd to be compatible with ADCore R3-3 where the
      time series support in NDPluginStats was changed. Also changed the port names so
      that multiple quadEM instances should be able to be run in the same IOC.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 9-1 (January 31, 2018)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the drvQuadEM base class when ring buffer overflow occurred. It
      was not decrementing a counter when it should, which would cause extra attempts
      to read the ring buffer, generating error messages. This could cause the TetrAMM
      to not recover from brief network outages, particularly on vxWorks.</li>
    <li>Removed the unlock()/lock() calls around doCallbacksGenericPointer. These are
      not needed and can cause problems because the thread needs to hold the lock here.</li>
    <li>Fixed the Reset function on the TetrAMM. It could hang the IOC application.</li>
    <li>Fixed turning acquisition off on the TetrAMM. It could get into an infinite loop
      and hang the IOC if the TetrAMM was not responding.</li>
    <li>Improved support for the AH501B from Elettra. This model has different firmware
      from the AH501B from CaenELS.
      <ul>
        <li>In External Gate mode it sends ACK\r\n on the falling edge of the gate signal.
          The driver has been changed to look for this string in the data stream in External
          Gate mode, and if it is found then it does callbacks immediately. This allows each
          acquisition to just be the samples collected when the external gate is high. The
          AveragingTime must be set to 0 in this mode.</li>
        <li>The NAQ command used when AcquireMode=Single actually starts acquisition. The
          driver therefore must not send ACQ because the acknowlegement of that command would
          mess up the data stream.</li>
        <li>It sends AK rather than ACK to acknowledge the HVS command. This is a firmware
          bug, but the driver has been changed to accept it.</li>
        <li>This model has been added to the list of available models, and is called AH501BE,
          where the "E" mean Elettra. This model name is specified in the drvAHxxxConfigure
          command.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fixed medm adl files to improve the autoconversion to other display manager files.</li>
    <li>Added op/Makefile to automatically convert adl files to edl, ui, and opi files.</li>
    <li>Updated the edl, ui, and opi autoconvert directories to contain the conversions
      from the most recent adl files.</li>
    <li>Fixed vxWorks dbd dependency rule</li>
    <li>Removed testBusyAsynApp which was added in R7-1. It never belonged in this module.
      The busy module has now been made to optionally depend on autosave, so the equivalent
      test application has been added to the busy module and is no longer needed here.</li>
    <li>Added .iocsh files to simplify startup scripts. Thanks to Keanan Lang for this.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 9-0 (September 18, 2017)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a problem with PingPong on the NSLS_EM. If ValuesPerRead&gt;1 then it now
      forces PingPong=Both. Previously if ValuesPerRead was even and PingPong was Phase0
      or Phase1 then the driver might not update because the device was only sending the
      other phase. Even if ValuesPerRead was odd the phase information was not correct.</li>
    <li>Finished documentation for NSLS2_EM.</li>
    <li>Changed the quadEM.template file to load NDArrayDriver.template, i.e. the database
      for the asynNDArrayDriver base class. This ensures that records for the base class
      are present. This change requires changing the startup scripts to pass ADDR=0 and
      TIMEOUT=1 when loading the device template file, because these macros are required
      by NDArrayDriver.template. Because this is not backwards compatible this is major
      release.</li>
    <li>Updated quadEMTestAppMain.cpp to the version in the template files in EPICS base
      3.15.5. This includes a call to epicsExit() after the iocsh() returns. This is needed
      for epicsAtExit to work correctly on some platforms, including Windows.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 8-0 (May 23, 2017)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Minor changes to be compatible with areaDetector/ADCore R3-0. The quadEM base
      class constructor has changed its arguments, so this is a major release. There are
      no changes required to startup scripts or OPI displays.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-1 (May 23, 2017)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for a new electrometer from Brookhaven National Laboratory. This
      is called NSLS2_EM in the documentation. This device consists of a 4-channel digital
      electrometer unit using a transconductance amplifier and built-in EPICS IOC running
      this software. The device provides 4-channel current measurements at up to 10 kHz.
      This model is capable of measuring larger currents than the NSLS Quad Electrometer
      (NSLS_EM). By compiling drvNSLS2_EM.cpp with the flags "-DSIMULATION_MODE -DPOLLING_MODE"
      the driver is simulator for quadEM, allowing testing with no hardware.</li>
    <li>Changed configure/CONFIG_SITE to not force static build on Linux.</li>
    <li>Added new testBusyAsynApp which is designed to test some problems with the asyn
      device support with the busy record. This does not really belong in quadEM, but
      it cannot be put in the busy or asyn modules because those don't include autosave,
      which is required to test the problem.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in External Gate mode for the AH501. External Gate mode previously
      did not work.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with the NSLS_EM. Recompute scaleFactor whenever integration time,
      range, or values per read change; previously it was only computed when acquisition
      started, which is not intuitive and led to amperes values that were incorrect.</li>
    <li>This release is compatible with ADCore R2-6.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-0 (October 31, 2016)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed the time-series and FFT support. Previously the time-series used the drvFastSweep
      driver from the synApps "mca" module. FFTs were done by an SNL program in the quadEM
      module. Now the time-series is done by the NDPluginTimeSeries plugin in areaDetector/ADCore.
      The FFT is now done by the NDPluginFFT plugin, also in ADCore. These changes mean
      that quadEM no longer depends on the mca or seq modules. They also add some significant
      new capabilities. For example the drvFastSweep driver is limited to epicsInt32 data,
      while the NDPluginTimeSeries plugin can handle any data type, including epicsFloat64
      which is what the quadEM driver produces.</li>
    <li>This release requires at least R2-5 of ADCore because the NDPluginFFT and NDPluginTimeSeries
      were not present in previous releases.</li>
    <li>Added support for TriggerPolarity on the TetrAMM.</li>
    <li>Improved the support for data acquisition applications, such as step-scan and
      on-the-fly scans using ion-chamber and photodiode detectors. This is particularly
      true for the TetrAMM model, using the new firmware version 2.9.XXX. This firmware
      version or later is required, because it adds features and fixes bugs present in
      earlier versions.</li>
    <li>Changed the AcquireMode choices from Continuous/One-shot to Continuous/Multiple/Single.
      Multiple will collect NumAcquire acquisitions and then stop. Single is the same
      as the previous One-shot, but using the same terminology as areaDetector.</li>
    <li>Changed the TriggerMode choices from Internal/ExternalTrigger/ExternalGate to
      FreeRun/Software/ExternalTrigger/ExternalBulb/ExternalGate. These are explained
      in the <a href="quadEMDoc.html">quadEMDoc documentation.</a></li>
    <li>Changed the units of the current values on the NSLS_EM from A/D units to amperes.
      This is the same as the TetrAMM. The AH401 and AH501 are still in A/D units, but
      these may also be changed to amperes in a future release.</li>
    <li>Added Precision PVs to control the number of digits displayed for each current,
      sum, difference, and position. Current1 controls SumX, Current2 controls SumAll,
      and Current3 controls SumY.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-0 (January 21, 2016)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for the CaenEls TetrAMM picoammeter. This device uses Gbit Ethernet
      without a built-in Ethernet to serial converter, so it is significantly faster than
      the AH501 and AH401 series. It supports on-board digital averaging. Note that TetrAMM
      firmware 2.0.09 or later is required because earlier versions have problems with
      the network stack.</li>
    <li>The base class and derived classes have changed somewhat to add this TetrAMM support,
      some of the database record names and types have changed, and changes are required
      to startup scripts. This is thus a new major release number. Some of the changes
      include
      <ul>
        <li>The Trigger record has been renamed to TriggerMode.</li>
        <li>The TriggerMode record choices are now device-dependent.</li>
        <li>The Firmware record changed from stringin to waveform to handle longer strings.</li>
        <li>New records were added for the TetrAMM (BiasInterlock, HVSReadback, HVVReadback,
          HVIReadback, and Temperature).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added support for the NSLS electrometer from Peter Siddons. It is called NSLS_EM
      in this software. It is quite similar to the AH401B and APS electrometer, using
      a similar current integrator chip. It has a minimum integration time of 400 microseconds,
      and thus a maximum sample rate of 2500 Hz. It uses Ethernet communication, UDP to
      search for modules on the subnet and TCP to send commands and read data.</li>
    <li>The CurrentScaleN and ReadStatus.SCAN records were added to save/restore, they
      were previously missing.</li>
    <li>Added support for reading the AH401, AH501, and TetrAMM meters in ASCII mode,
      as well as the binary mode that was previously supported. Binary mode can occassionally
      get out of sync, because there are no terminators between readings. ASCII mode is
      slower, but should not have a problem getting out of sync. The new ReadFormat record
      is used to select Binary or ASCII.</li>
    <li>Template files in $(TOP)/quadEMApp/Db are now installed into $(TOP)/db when building
      and the example IOC now loads them from the install directory.</li>
    <li>The device-specific template files now load the base class quadEM.template file
      using an "include" statement, so the base file no longer needs to be explicitly
      loaded in the startup script. This means that $(QUADEM)/db must be added to EPICS_DB_INCLUDE_PATH.</li>
    <li>This release requires areaDetector ADCore R2-4 or later.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 5-0 (October 14, 2014)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Supported a new geometry where the current sources are arranged in a square array
      with 2 on the top and 2 on the bottom, in addition to the previous diamond geometry
      of top, bottom, left right. The sum, difference and position calculations are done
      differently in this geometry.</li>
    <li>Added a new Geometry PV that controls which geometry (Diamond, Square) is used
      in the calculations.</li>
    <li>Because the diodes that contribute to the sum, difference and position calculations
      depend on the geometry, the names of the Sum, Diff and Position PVs have changed.
      <ul>
        <li>Sum12, Sum34 have changed to SumX, SumY</li>
        <li>Diff12, Diff34 have changed to DiffX, DiffY</li>
        <li>Position12, Position34 have changed to PositionX, PositionY</li>
        <li>Sum1234 has changed to SumAll</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 4-1 (April 14, 2014)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added new AcquireMode record to support both Continuous and One-shot acquisition
      modes. Previously only continuous acquisition was supported. One-shot acquires the
      data from one AveragingTime and then stops acquisition. One-shot mode can be used
      with either triggered or free-running acquisition.<br />
      Note: Correct operation of the One-shot mode and triggered modes on the AH501D requires
      firmware version 2.0 or later. Previous firmware versions have bugs that prevent
      correct operation in these modes. The firmware can be updated in the field.</li>
    <li>The Acquire record was changed from a bo to a busy record to support use with
      the sscan record when AcquireMode=One-shot.</li>
    <li>Added optional "modelName" parameter to the constructors and configuration commands
      for the startup scripts. This allows one to specify what model of AH401x or AH501x
      is being used. The driver attempts to detect this automatically from the firmware
      version it reads from the device, but some of the Elettra units have strange firmware
      version strings so this can fail.</li>
    <li>Fix to allow fast feedback to work on APS_EM.</li>
    <li>Added new Firmware stringin record containing the firmware version from the device.</li>
    <li>Changed to use R2-0 of areaDetector. It only uses the ADCORE and ADBINARIES modules.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 4-0 (March 12, 2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Major update of the module. The device-dependent classes (AHxxx, APS_EM) have
      not changed signficantly. However the base quadEM class has been rewritten. In R3-x
      the quadEM base class worked as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>The ai records for the 11 parameters (Current[1-3],Sum[12,34,1234],Diff[12,34],
          and Position[12,34]) were computed using the asynInt32Average device support.
        </li>
        <li>This meant that there were 11 callbacks each time a new value came from the electrometer,
          or more than 70,000 callbacks per second under some circumstances. This was a significant
          CPU load.</li>
        <li>This approach produced average values, but it did not produce other useful statistics
          like the standard deviation, histogram of values, etc.</li>
        <li>There was no good way to stream all of the readings to a disk file for an arbitrarily
          long time. The TimeSeries support was limited to a fixed time length, limited by
          available memory.</li>
      </ul>
      R4-0 addresses these problems as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>The quadEM base class is now derived from the asynNDArray class in areaDetector,
          rather than directly from asynPortDriver.</li>
        <li>The data from the device-dependent drivers are now first placed into a ring buffer
          whose size is defined in the constructor.</li>
        <li>There is a new PV called AveragingTime that determines the time period over which
          to average the readings. The AveragingTime divided by the SampleTime determines
          the number of samples to average, NumAverage_RBV. When this number of samples have
          been accumulated in the ring buffer a separate thread copies them to a set of NDArrays
          and calls any registered plugins. </li>
        <li>There is a separate NDPluginStats plugin loaded for each of the 11 data values.
          This plugin receives an array of dimensions [NumAverage_RBV]. This plugin computes
          not only the mean (as in the previous version), but also the standard deviation,
          histogram of values, etc.</li>
        <li>One of the NDArrays contains all of the data values, and has dimensions [11,NumAverage_RBV].
          This array can be passed to any of the file writing plugins, which can thus stream
          all of the data to disk for arbitrarily long time periods.</li>
        <li>An NDStdArrays plugin is also loaded. This can be used to pass all of the data
          [11,NumAverage_RBV] or any of the individual data arrays to any channel access client.</li>
        <li>This new approach provides much more information and flexibility. But it also
          significantly reduces the number of callbacks. For example if the averaging time
          is 1 second the number of callbacks is reduced from thousands per second to 12 per
          second, because the data are being passed in arrays.</li>
        <li>The computationally intensive work of calculating the statistics is now being
          done in plugins, so can be done in different threads, each potentially running in
          a separate core on modern CPUs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 3-3 (December 20, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed problem with mutex locking on AH401 (and perhaps AH501). The lock was not
      being released for in the read task for long enough to allow EPICS to quickly stop
      acquisition.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 3-2 (December 6, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug in reading binary data from AH501 meters. The manual incorrectly documented
      the binary data format.</li>
    <li>New version of the AH501D manual that correctly documents the binary data format.</li>
    <li>Minor changes to avoid compiler warnings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 3-1 (September 13, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for AH401D and the AH501 series (AH501, AH501C, AH501D) picoammeters
      from CaenEls. The AH501 series are significantly faster than the AH401 series. They
      work differently than the AH401 or APS_EM units, and do not support the concept
      of integration time or ping-pong. They have programmable resolution (16-bit or 24-bits),
      programmable number of active input channels (1, 2, or 4), and programmable bias
      power supply (AH501C and AH501D only).</li>
    <li>Added new record NumAverage. This applies to all models, and can be used to average
      NumAverage readings from the meter before doing the callbacks. On the AH501 series
      this also reduces the number of read operations by a factor of NumAverage, by increasing
      the number of messages read in a single operation. This reduces CPU time in direct
      proportion to NumAverage, which is particularly important with slow computers (e.g.
      older VME cards) with the AH501 series.</li>
    <li>Tested using UDP rather than TCP for communication with the AH401B and AH501 meters.
      This is more efficient than TCP, reducing CPU time by up to 10%. The example startup
      scripts now use UDP. The Lantronix DeviceInstaller must be used to configure the
      electrometer to use UDP, since the default is TCP.</li>
    <li>Added new record Model. This provides the model index and name of the device.
      This is determined automatically by the driver.</li>
    <li>Modified the medm screens so they only display the parameters that apply to the
      specific model being used.</li>
    <li>Modified startup scripts to simplify and support testing all models on any OS
      (for AH401 and AH501 series), and vxWorks for APS_EM.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 3-0 (September 6, 2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete re-write of the module. The new version is based on asynPortDriver. It
      consists of a base class, drvQuadEM.cpp, and two derived classes:
      <ol>
        <li>drvAH401B.cpp which is new support for the AH401B picoammeter designed and sold
          by <a href="http://ilo.elettra.trieste.it/index.php?page=_layout_prodotto&amp;id=54&amp;lang=en">
            Synchrotron Trieste (elettra)</a>. It is also sold by <a href="http://www.caenels.com/caenels/product.php?fam=cemis&amp;mod=AH401B">
              CAENels</a>. </li>
        <li>drvAPS_EM.cpp, which is improved support for the APS electrometer designed by
          Steve Ross.</li>
      </ol>
      The new version is not completely backwards compatible with the previous version,
      and will require modification of startup scripts and medm screens. </li>
    <li>Added support for power-spectra calculations using FFTs on time-series arrays.
      These now run in the IOC, rather than requiring a separate Channel Access client,
      which previous releases required.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 2-6 (November 2, 2011)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for the remote reboot capability of the electrometer. This makes
      initialization much simpler and more robust, since it can be done with software
      commands rather than power-cycling and toggling switches. It is only supported on
      newer electrometer firmware, but does not cause ill effects when sent to older electrometers.
      Added a Reboot record to the database, and modified the Initialize seq record to
      process the Reboot record as the first thing it does.</li>
    <li>Added an additional optional parameter to initQuadEM. This is the drvInfo field
      for the ipUnidig module. Previously the driver hardcoded pasynUser-&gt;reason=0
      when using the asynUInt32Digital interface. Now it uses drvUser-&gt;create, which
      is the correct way to do it.</li>
    <li>Created new documentation file, <a href="quadEMDoc.html">quadEMDoc.html</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 2-5 (Sept 9, 2011)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Modified RELEASE; deleted RELEASE.arch.</li>
    <li>Added .opi display files, for CSS-BOY</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 2-4-1 (March 30, 2010)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Support parallel build.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 2-4 (May 19, 2008)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Removed unused functions in driver.</li>
    <li>Added new adl file quadEM_less.adl.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in quadEM_settings.req.</li>
  </ul>
